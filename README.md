# HR Analytics - CanadaRetail:

Business Analytics Immersion Week

## Introduction:
Since the retail market in Canada has become increasingly competitive, CanadaRetail has been struggling to attract and retain top talent to help them execute their strategic objectives and believe it is time for them to revise their **human capital strategies** to align with their business strategies. They see an opportunity to create a sustainable competitive advantage through:
1. developing a positive employer brand, and
2. attracting, developing, and retaining top talent.

They are open to investing in their employment branding. One of their goals is to create a positive employer brand that aligns with their strategies and creates a positive reputation appealing to the type of employees who will be productive at CanadaRetail and tend to stay with the organization for a long time. Retention of top talent has always been an issue for CanadaRetail. They believe that they need to start with their sales associates because they are the face of the organization and the ones who drive revenue, but, at the same time, have the highest turnover rate compared to other employees.

We attempt to generate some strategic plans regarding **HR practices** such as recruitment, selection, training and development, compensation, and performance management to help CanadaRetail improve their employer branding and achieve its strategic goals mentioned above
We aim to provide actionable and evidence-based recommendations that convince the management team to follow them.

## Data:
The organization provided:
1. store level data
2. personnel data

CanadianRetailâ€™s top competitors are BestBuy Canada, Staples, and Canadian Tire. Historically, CanadianRetail's financial performance is very similar to that of Canadian Tire. We analyse publicly available financial reports from FY2019 for Canada Tire.

## Code:
We perform our analysis in Jupyter Notebook using Python 3.9.
1. personnel_analysis.ipynb: We use techniques such as data cleaning, data visualization, linear regression, and k-means clustering to generate insights on recruitment, employee retention, and employee performance.
2. store_analysis.ipynb: We use time series analysis to analyse turnover rate and sales performance across over 8,000 stores.

## Results:
The final report is available in Team-1-Final-Report.pdf. We provide actionable and evidence-based recommendations that convince the management team to follow them.
